# Recursive-Maze
Program that recursively solves a character based Maze that is entered by the user
This program was created in my third level Java course at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Yumin Lu.
In the program the user is prompted to enter in a two dimensional character array that represents a 'Maze'. After
the "Maze" is entered, the program uses recursion to guide itself through the maze in as many ways a possible printing
them out as it goes along until all possible paths have been found.


# Future Improvements
- Graphical User Interface
- Ability to create another Maze
- Show user shortest/longest route to exit
- User manipulation of Maze after it has been created
